# BASIC HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT STARTER

A basic html/css/javascript project starter for beginners.

## Usage
This starter is intended for use by beginners looking to make their own web projects without
having to write out the skeletons for their html/css/javascript, or setup a basic file system.
I intended this to be a starter for my freecodecamp front-end projects, and this should be
sufficient to get you started if you wanted to work on your projects locally or put them on github.

To use:
- The file system is organized according to an MDN's instructional documentation, which is linked [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)
  - MDN is a great resource in general, and is the go-to-place for html/css/javascript documentation.
- You can write your html in index.html, just delete the placeholders and comments and add your own html.
- Custom css can be added in /styles/main.css.
  - The starter already comes pre-linked to Bootstrap, Normalize, and Font Awesome, so you don't need
    to customize your css unless you want to. For quick links to their pages see below:
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
- You can write your javascript/jQuery in /scripts/app.js. The '$(document).ready()' block is already filled out.
  Just delete the comments and boilerplate code, and code away.
  - The starter comes with jQuery linked, and you can find documentation [HERE](https://jquery.com/)
- If you have any images that you want to save in the file system, you can put them in the 'images' folder.
  - When referencing them as a source in your html, the URL will be "./images/YOURFILENAME.EXENTSION".
